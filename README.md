# **WiDS : Quantum Machine Learning**

This repository contains my work in the project Learning with Quantum Computers as a part of Winter in Data Science (WiDS) conducted by the Analytics Club, IIT Bombay under mentors Aditya Sriram and Siddhant Midha. The project repository can be found [here](https://github.com/siddhant-midha/WiDS-22-Learning-with-quantum-computers-)

# *Reading so far* : 
1. Completed chapter 1
2. Completed chapter 2
3. Completed chapter 4 (upto universal quantum circuits)
4. Completed chapter 5, 6

# *Coding so far* : 
1. Completed problems 1, 2, 3.
2. "Twist" problem is in progress
3. Added a notebook to list different functionalities offered in Qiskit. [This](https://github.com/Ihsoj-Mahos/WiDS-QML/blob/master/Week%201/QML_Intro.ipynb) can be referred by people unfamiliar with QC (like I was :p)
4. Qubit rotation [tutorial](https://pennylane.ai/qml/demos/tutorial_qubit_rotation.html) in progress

# *Paper reading* :
