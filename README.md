# **WiDS : Quantum Machine Learning**

This repository contains my work in the project Learning with Quantum Computers as a part of Winter in Data Science (WiDS) conducted by the Analytics Club, IIT Bombay under mentors Aditya Sriram and Siddhant Midha. The project repository can be found [here](https://github.com/siddhant-midha/WiDS-22-Learning-with-quantum-computers-)

# *Reading so far* : 
1. Completed chapter 1
2. Completed chapter 2
3. Completed chapter 4 (upto universal quantum circuits)
4. Completed chapter 5, 6

# *Coding so far* : 
1. Completed problems 1, 2, 3.
2. "Twist" problem is in progress
3. Added a notebook to list different functionalities offered in Qiskit. [This](https://github.com/Ihsoj-Mahos/WiDS-QML/blob/master/Week%201/QML_Intro.ipynb) can be referred by people unfamiliar with QC (like I was :p)
4. Qubit rotation [tutorial](https://pennylane.ai/qml/demos/tutorial_qubit_rotation.html) completed.

# *Paper reading* : 
1. Completed reading Intro to QML [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1409.3097)
2. Intro to QML for engineers [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.09510) completed
3. Here is a nice resource for [learning how to read papers](https://web.stanford.edu/class/ee384m/Handouts/HowtoReadPaper.pdf)
4. Completed this [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1804.08641.pdf) for the lit review
5. Read supporting papers [1](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1406.2661.pdf), [2](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2010.06201.pdf) 

# *Report* : 
1. Completed chapter 1,2 survey
2. Completed chapter 4,5,6 survey
3. Completed survey of intro to QML papers
4. Literature survey completed. Report [link](https://github.com/Ihsoj-Mahos/WiDS-QML/blob/master/Report/report.pdf)

# *Implementation* : 
1. One can refer [this](https://pennylane.ai/qml/demos/tutorial_quantum_gans.html#sphx-glr-demos-tutorial-quantum-gans-py) for implementation of QuGANs
